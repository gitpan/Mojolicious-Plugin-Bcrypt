NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Bcrypt - bcrypt your passwords!

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Provides a helper for crypting and validating passwords via bcrypt.

        use Mojolicious::Plugin::Bcrypt;

        sub startup {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->plugin('bcrypt', { cost => 4 });
        }

        ...

    Optional parameter "cost" is a non-negative integer controlling the cost
    of the hash function. The number of operations is proportional to
    2^cost. The current default value is 6.

HELPERS
  bcrypt
    Crypts a password via the bcrypt algorithm.

        $self->bcrypt( $password, $settings );

    $settings is an optional string which encodes the algorithm parameters,
    as described in Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt.

        sub signup {
            my $self = shift;
            my $crypted_pass = $self->bcrypt( $self->param('password') );
            ...
        }

  bcrypt_validate
    Validates a password against a crypted copy (for example from your
    database).

        sub login {
            my $self = shift;
            my $entered_pass = $self->param('password');
            my $crypted_pass = $self->get_password_from_db();
            if ( $self->bcrypt_validate( $entered_pass, $crypted_pass ) ) {

                # Authenticated
                ...;
            }
            else {

                # Wrong password
                ...;
            }
        }
